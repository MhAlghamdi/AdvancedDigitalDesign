# Multifunction barrel shifterConsider an 8-bit shifting circuit that can perform rotating right or rotating left. An additional 1-bit control signal, lr, specifies the desired direction.
1. Design the circuit using one rotate-right circuit, one rotate-left circuit, and one 2-to-1 multiplexer to select the desired result. Derive the code.2. Derive a testbench and use simulation to verify operation of the code.3. Synthesize the circuit, program the FPGA, and verify its operation.4. This circuit can also be implemented by one rotate-right shifler with pre- and postreversing circuits. The reversing circuit either passes the original input or reverses the input bitwise (e.g., if an 8-bit input is a_7a_6a_5a_4a_3a_2a_1a_0, the reversed result becomes a_0a_1a_2a_3a_5a_5a_6a_7). Repeat steps 2 and 3.5. Check the report files and compare the number of logic cells and propagation delays of the two designs.6. Expand the code for a 16-bit circuit and synthesize the code. Repeat steps 1 to 5.7. Expand the code for a 32-bit circuit and synthesize the code. Repeat steps 1 to 5.
